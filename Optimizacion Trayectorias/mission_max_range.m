%% Code for solving Max Range for a given Energy

% This code takes as inputs:

    % Aerodynamic wind tunnel model // polar simplified model from previous
    % Propulsive  wind tunnel model (Marta Nu√±ez, 2022). 2 dof model
    % collapsed to phi = 0.
    
    % Weights parameters from last version (June 2022)
    
% It calculates the points via fcmincon and generates the sections of the
% solution function with respect to its independent variables at the point of the
% optimal solution.
